# Insurance Premium Prediction using Regression Algorithms

###

Objective of this project is to find a way to estimate the value in the *charges* column using the values in the other columns. I did it using historical data, then estimated charges for new customers, simply by asking for basic information like their age, sex, BMI, no. of children, smoking habits and region.

## Tech Stack

**Language:** Python.

**Libraries:** numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statistics, math, scipy, sklearn.
